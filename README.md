However, the impact is negated when rounding occurs.  This is not surprising given that Thomas High School only had 461 9th graders, so the impact of their removal out of a district with 39,170 students would not be significant on a district-wide level.

## School Summary Impact
The removal of the 9th graders from Thomas had a severe impact on Thomas High School's scores.  This is understandable given the school had an entire grade level's worth of data removed.
