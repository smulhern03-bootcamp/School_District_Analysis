## District Summary Impact
The removal of the 9th graders from Thomas High School had a slight impact on the District's scores.  Unsurprisingly, all the scores were lowered - some more than others.

However, the impact is negated when rounding occurs.  This is not surprising given that Thomas High School only had 461 9th graders, so the impact of their removal out of a district with 39,170 students would not be significant on a district-wide level.

## School Summary Impact
The removal of the 9th graders from Thomas had a severe impact on Thomas High School's scores.  This is understandable given the school had an entire grade level's worth of data removed.
